    <h2>Delilia Werner</h2>
    <h3>Pronounced like the Biblical Delilah</h3>
    <p>Hey Y'all. Well, I don't actually say Y'all, but I do live in the South. I was born in California, raised in Alabama, and I currently live in Georgia.<br>
         My husband Ralf and I will be married forty years in December. We have five children and one grandchild.</p>
    <p>I graduated from BYU-I two years ago with my Associates degree in Family History Research and decided I had enough schooling,<br>
         but changed my mind last Spring and started working on a Bachelors degree in Interdiciplinary Studies. </p>
    <p>I chose to pursue a certificate in frontend web design because I want to design my own website when I decide to do genealogy professionally.<br>
        My husband is an IT Specialist and my youngest son just earned a Bachelors degree in Computer Science, so I have lots of help.</p>
    <p>I currently serve as the 1st counselor in our Stake Primary presidency, I am an Ordinance worker in the Atlanta, Georgia temple, <br>
        and the family history consultant in my ward. I love to do genealogy, I dabble in herbal remedies, and I quilt. I try and read every now and then, too.<br>
        I had my first knee operation when I was 29 years old that ended my being too active.</p>
    <p>My favorite scripture is Alma 37:36-37, because it reminds me of where I draw my strength and in Whom I put my trust.</p>
