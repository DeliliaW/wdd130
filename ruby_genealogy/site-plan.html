      <p>
        <b>About Me</b><br><br>
        Hello! My name is Delilia Werner. Ok, full disclosure. My full name is Ruby Delilia Baker Werner. I am named after both my grandmothers- Ruby Bell Langston Brackner and Bertha Delilia Emfinger Baker. As I thought of a name for my business, I was reminded of the strong family ties to both sides of my family- beginning with my name. I wanted my company to reflect those ties, as family-yours, mine, and theirs- is what it is all about. My passion for finding those that are lost in time knows no familial bounds! <br><br> 
        I have over 20 years experience researching my own family. I started doing my own family history research earnestly in 2003 while dragging my youngest son to cemeteries and the homes of newfound family connections. I have also helped many friends and a few clients. I later pursued a more formal path of learning and graduated with an associate degree in Family History Research from BYU-Idaho in 2022. I continue learning by taking courses offered online through various websites with a goal of becoming an Accredited Genealogist though ICAPGen.<br>
        I have research experience mostly in the Southeast United States, but I have done client work in other states such as New York and Missouri, as well. . Using a solid research plan and good methodology allows any place to be researched. I have many genealogy subscriptions that grant me access to many different record types.
